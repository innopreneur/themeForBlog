<!--
If you want to include any custom html just before </head>, put it in /layouts/partials/head_custom.html
Do not put anything in this file - it's only here so that hugo won't throw an error if /layouts/partials/head_custom.html doesn't exist.
-->

<!-- for example, you could insert this custom css, which makes the bigimg not stretch:
<style>
.intro-header.big-img, .intro-header.big-img  .big-img-transition {
  -webkit-background-size: contain !important;
  -moz-background-size: contain !important;
  background-size: contain !important;
  -o-background-size: contain !important;
  background-color: lightgrey;
}
</style>
-->
<!-- or you could include some additional css libraries:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vis/4.19.1/vis.css" integrity="sha256-I1UoFd33KHIydu88R9owFaQWzwkiZV4hXXug5aYaM28=" crossorigin="anonymous" />
