If you want to include any custom html just before </head>, put it in /layouts/partials/head_custom.html
Do not put anything in this file - it's only here so that hugo won't throw an error if /layouts/partials/head_custom.html doesn't exist.

  -moz-background-size: contain !important;
  background-size: contain !important;
