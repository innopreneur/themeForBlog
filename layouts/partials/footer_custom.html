<!--
If you want to include any custom html just before </body>, put it in /layouts/partials/footer_custom.html
Do not put anything in this file - it's only here so that hugo won't throw an error if /layouts/partials/footer_custom.html doesn't exist.

<!-- for example, you could include some js libraries:
